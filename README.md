# ECE 450 - Semester Project CodeBase

## Code Sharing

Welcome to the Bitbucket account for sharing all of the code for the ECE450 semester project. This site will let us collaborate to create the code and test the latest updates without the need for extensive emailing or in person meetings. 

## Getting Started

All of the below should take you about 1-2 hours to run through and get a full understanding of what's going on. 

If you have never used a git repository before take the time to familiarize yourself with how it works. You'll need a Bitbucket account - but first go through [this tutorial](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/cgozDQ). If you want to find out what git is before diving in, [see this link for the full explanation](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics).

I highly recommend using a GUI to manage your repositories, especially if you're unfamiliar with the commandline and git. Once you've walked through the above info and tutorial. Take a look at [this tutorial](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Sourcetree+Git+GUI+on+Windows), and download [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for either Mac or Windows.

Once you're through the tutorials and somewhat comfortable with the process, contact me at dwernli2 @ our school and I'll get you read/write access to this repository. Even without read access you can [download](https://bitbucket.org/slapyak/ece450_semester-project/downloads) the repository at any time as a zip file.
